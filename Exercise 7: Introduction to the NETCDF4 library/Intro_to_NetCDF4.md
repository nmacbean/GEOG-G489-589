# Exercise 7: Introduction to Seaborn and string splitting

In today's class we're going to learn about Python's netCDF4 library for dealing with NetCDF files. Netcdf is a file format that supports large geospatial array-like data (find out more here: https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/). It is a commonly used format for global climate reanalyses (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorological_reanalysis), for climate/earth system model outputs, and for remote sensing products. 

We will also learn about using NumPy's masked array functions to mask out missing values in numerical arrays. 

The Python library for working with netcdf files is called netCDF4. You can find more information here: http://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/. It has been loaded onto these computers, but you can use typical Python package managers such as pip (https://pypi.org/project/netCDF4/) and anaconda (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/netcdf4) to install it on your own computers.

There will be no in-class exercise today - we will just go through the powerpoint slides together in class. You will have time to practice what we are learning in the in-class exercise next week. You can find the powerpoint slides and the data we will use for the class in this "Exercise 7" folder.
