# Exercise 11: Handling missing values using scikit-learn and pandas in preparation for statistical data analysis using SciPy

In today's class we're going to work through an exploratory data analysis and go through some ways of handling missing data (using pandas and scikit-learn method) before we are able to perform a simple statistical analysis (using SciPy).

We have not yet learned about scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/) or Scipy (https://www.scipy.org) python libraries; however, the code that you will need is given in the in-class exercise notes in the Jupyter Notebook that you will be working through yourselves. We will learn more about these two libraries and the types of analyses they can be used for in the final part of the semester.

Download the jupyter notebook and data zipped folders and then work through the exercise in the jupyter notebook file called "Exercise 11 Handling Missing Data.ipynb". 

Upload your completed jupyter notebook to Canvas by Monday 21st October at 1pm.
