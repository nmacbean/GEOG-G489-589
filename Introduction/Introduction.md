# Welcome to GEOG-G489/589: Advanced Geospatial Data Analysis in Python! 

During this first class week we will go over the course as well as a basic introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebooks. We'll also get started by doing the first two tutorials in the DataCamp.com Introduction to Python Module.

1) Take a look through the Course Introduction in the powerpoint presentation in the attached folder. It includes a 10 minute introductory video in which I briefly introduce myself and the course content and structure.

2) Carefully read through the syllabus (found under the course repository main directory). 

3) Complete the Course Expectations Questionnaire (due 11:59pm Thursday 29th August). The questionnaire can be downloaded from the Week 1: Introduction folder. You will upload this questionnaire under the relevant assignment on Canvas.

4) The final exercise for you to do this week will be two DataCamp.com tutorials. By now you should have received an invitation to the DataCamp.com academic classroom. Logging on and accessing our virtual classroom and the assignments should be fairly straightforward, but please let me know if you're having problems. You will need to use your @indiana.edu email.

Have a go at the first two tutorials in the Introduction to Python Course (https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) - Python Basics and Python Lists - before the beginning of our first class on the 4th September. 

As I explained in the video and syllabus, I will occasionally set DataCamp tutorials as optional "homework" assignments. These will not be graded. However, I strongly recommend you do these two tutorials if you are new to Python or returning to Python and/or programming after a break. 

Please let me know if you have any further questions after you have gone through the introductory presentation and the syllabus. I will be happy to answer any questions.
