# Exercise 8: More on netCDF4 and plotting geospatial data with imshow()

In today's class we're going to learn more about the netCDF4 library and how to access information from netcdf files. We're also going to take a mini detour to learn about dictionaries. Finally, we'll learn how to make quick plots of geospatial data using the matplotlib function imshow().

## In-class exercise
In our in-class exercise today, our objective is to do a quick exploratory plotting data analysis to see how GPP changes over the year. *How might we do this?*
