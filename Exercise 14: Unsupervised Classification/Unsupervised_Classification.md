# Exericse 14: Unsupervised hyperspectral image classification

This week we will be learning about unsupervised learning using the KMeans Clustering analysis from scikit-learn. We will be applying this to classify hyperspectral imagery to determine fraction of land cover types (shrub, grass, bare soil) at the semi-arid Santa Rita site in southern Arizona.

In today's class our guest lecturer Rubaya Pervin will be talking through the methods as well as the data cleaning and tidying process.

In Wednesday's class we'll be doing an in-class exercise to practice the image classification using KMeans clustering.

Today's (Monday's) homework is to complete the DataCamp tutorial on "lustering for Dataset Exploration: (Chapter 1) of the Unsupervised Learning Module: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/unsupervised-learning-in-python. This will help you to become more familiar with the KMeans method before Wednesday's in-class exercise.
