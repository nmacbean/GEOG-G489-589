# Exericse 14: Unsupervised hyperspectral image classification

This week we will be learning about unsupervised learning using the KMeans Clustering analysis from scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html). We will be applying this to classify hyperspectral imagery to determine fraction of land cover types (shrub, grass, bare soil) at the semi-arid Santa Rita site in southern Arizona.

In today's class our guest lecturer Rubaya Pervin will be talking through the methods as well as the data cleaning and tidying process.

In Wednesday's class we'll be doing an in-class exercise to practice the image classification using KMeans clustering.

Today's (Monday's) homework is to complete the DataCamp tutorial on "lustering for Dataset Exploration: (Chapter 1) of the Unsupervised Learning Module: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/unsupervised-learning-in-python. This will help you to become more familiar with the KMeans method before Wednesday's in-class exercise.

## In-class exercise: KMeans Clustering for unsupervised classification at Santa Rita site

In today's exercise you will follow the classification steps taught in the lecture on Monday to classifiy hyperspectral dataset from a different part of the Santa Rita Experimental site. The photo below shows the camera image of area we'll be classifying.


The data have already been cleaned as described on Monday (removing missing and negative numbers, cleaning the bad/noisy bands of information). They are provided in the tif in the data folder Follow the steps below to complete the exercise and then answer the following questions.
