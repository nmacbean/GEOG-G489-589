The file \"FLUXNET_US-SRG_Daily_ET_Met_2009-2014.csv\" contains ET data (evapotranspiration - which is both evaporation of water from bare surfaces and transpiration of moisture from plants) as well as four meteorological variables: TAir (air temperature), Precip, VPD (vapor pressure deficit) and PA (surface air pressure).\n",

I.e. the task is to calculate the R$^{2}$ (r-squared) value - i.e. the square of the correlation - between ET and each of the 4 different meteorological variables and then print out the values to see which one is highest.\n",
