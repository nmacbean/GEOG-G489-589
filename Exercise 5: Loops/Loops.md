# Exercise 5: Loops (and a bit more on Pandas)

In today's class we're first going to learn about the for loop
First, we will go through the class notes together. You can find the powerpoint slides for the class in this "Exercise 5" folder.

## In-class exercise
Our in-class exercise today is to complete the following in a Jupyter Notebook (with comments for each task!):  
* Dowload data.zip --> it should contain all 4 files for the 4 Ameriflux sites
* Using what we have learned today in class, create a list of the files using glob
* Then loop over the files and…
* Print the simple descriptive statistics for each site
* Still within the loop, calculate (and save to a NumPy array) the total precipitation (column “P”) for each site
* Which numpy command will we use for this?
* Outside the loop, print out your total precipitation results for all sites.


**That's it for today. Remember to upload your .ipynb jupyter notebook to Canvas by 5pm TOMORROW Tuesday 17th September **
