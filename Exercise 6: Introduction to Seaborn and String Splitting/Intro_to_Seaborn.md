# Exercise 6: Introduction to Seaborn and string splitting

In today's class we're first going to learn about the Seaborn Python package for statistical data visualization. We're also going to learn about how to split strings to get useful information from the filename and/or to easily create new filenames.

There will be no in-class exercise today - we will just go through the powerpoint slides together in class. You will have time to practice what we are learning throughout the class. You can find the powerpoint slides for the class in this "Exercise 6" folder.
