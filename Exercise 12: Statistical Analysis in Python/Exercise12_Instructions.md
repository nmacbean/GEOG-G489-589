# Exercise 12: Statistical Analysis in Python

In today's class we're going to learn about the main libraries that you can use for doing statistical analyses in Python. Follow the course notes in the powerpoint slides in the Exercise 12 folder on the GitHub page.

There is no in-class exercise today. However, I recommend the following DataCamp tutorials to supplement your learning about these Python packages:
1. DataCamp Module “Introduction to Linear Modeling in Python”:
 * https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-linear-modeling-in-python
2. Two other chapters that could be useful:
  * 2nd chapter of Supervised Learning with scikit-learn: Regression: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn
  * 4th chapter of Exploratory Data Analysis in Python: Multivariate Thinking: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/exploratory-data-analysis-in-python (at least first few sections)
