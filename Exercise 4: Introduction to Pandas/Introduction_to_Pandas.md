# Exercise 4: Introduction to Pandas

In today's class we're first going to go have a first look at the Pandas Python Data Analysis package: https://pandas.pydata.org

Pandas has its own data structures, which we will look at today. It is useful for dealing with tabular data - especially datasets that contain a mix of numerical, categorical and string data.

First, we will go through the class notes together. You can find the powerpoint slides for the class in this "Exercise 4" folder.
