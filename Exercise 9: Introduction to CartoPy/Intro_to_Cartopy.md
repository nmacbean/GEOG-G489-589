# Exercise 9: Introduction to CartoPy for plotting maps with geospatial coordinates

In today's class we're going to learn about the CartoPy Python library for plotting maps with geospatial coordinates (i.e. with latitudes and longitudes). Follow the notes in the powerpoint in the Exercise 9 folder.


## In-class exercise
We'll use what we have learned previously about reading data from NetCDF files and what we've learned today to perform visual analyses comparing the GPP dataset we used in the last class to satellite measurements of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). SIF is a byproduct of photosynthesis; therefore, it should be a good proxy for GPP.  
The SIF data were collected from the GOME-2 satellite (https://www.eumetsat.int/website/home/Satellites/CurrentSatellites/Metop/MetopDesign/GOME2/index.html).  
In our analysis we will use the SIF to evaluate if the model contains an accurate representation of photosynthesis processes.
