# Exercise 10: Introduction to GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library)

In today's class we're going to learn about GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) for reading and manipulating raster remote sensing data.

Download the jupyter notebook and data zipped folders and then work through the exercise in the jupyter notebook file (in the jupyter notebook directory) called "Exercise 10 Introduction to GDAL". 

Upload your completed jupyter notebook to Canvas by Monday 14th October at 11:59pm. There will be time in class on Monday to go through any questions you have on this in-class exercise.
