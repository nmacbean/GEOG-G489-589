# Exercise 2: Python Lists, Functions/Methods and A Brief Introduction to the Numerical Python (NumPy) package

In today's class we're going to go over some of the basic Python functionality you learned in the DataCamp tutorials last week before having a brief introduction to NumPy - Python's Numerical Data Analysis Package.

You can find out more about NumPy here: https://numpy.org




### Supplementary exercises:

In the DataCamp tutorials last week and in today's class we have talked about methods for different data types. To better familiarize yourself, take a look at the supplementary exercises below.

1) Take a read of this page https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex to learn more about numeric types in Python, the operations you can do, and the methods associated with each type. Have a play with some of these methods in IPython interactive command line prompt in one of the Python Basics exercise. Google other Python int and float methods. What do float.floor() float.ceil() do? Why might that be useful for your work?
Now do the same with string (str) data types: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str . What does str.find() do?

2) You learnt about Python lists as one type of Python Data Structures in one tutorial. Here is some more information on lists and the methods associated to list objects (sections 5.1 and 5.2): https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html. Note: there is information on other Data Structures in Python in Section 5.3 onwards, but we will get to that later in the course. Have a read of this page and go to your Jupyter Notebook to play with some of these functions using the lists created in class or in the the DataCamp tutorials.

3) The tutorials in DataCamp went through built-in functions, but at this initial stage they only mentioned a few. To learn more, Google Python built-in functions for version 3.5 and later. (E.g. Take a look here at some of the other built-in functions for Python 3.x: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html). Have a play with some of these functions using one a practice Jupyter Notebook. Use the help() function to see the documentation, or just google the specific function to find out more.

4) The tutorials in DataCamp last week also touched on the math package in Python. Have a read of this page to find out more about the functions and methods available in this package: https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#module-math. Think how this might be useful for your work/research.
